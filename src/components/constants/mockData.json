(A few years later, nearby towns Langenordnach, Schwärzenbach and Waldau also joined the union.) Long known as a spa town, Titisee sits on the banks of the lake of the same name. Legend says the name came from Roman Emperor Titus, who was so taken by its beauty that he named it after himself. The area is great for hiking and winter sports.",
